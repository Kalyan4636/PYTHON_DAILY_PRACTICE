#Program Explanation
# 1. User must enter the coefficients of the equations and store it in three separate variables.
# 2. The value value of the discriminant, d, is found out which determines the nature of roots of the equation.
# 3. If the value of the discriminant is lesser than 0, the roots are imaginary.
# 4. If the value of the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots arenâ€™t imaginary.
# 5. The value of the roots is found out using the quadratic formula.
# 6. The roots of the equation are printed.
